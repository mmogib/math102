**Course Objective:** The objective of the course is to introduce students to the topics of
definite & indefinite integrals, series, and their applications.

**Course Content:** Definite and indefinite integrals of functions of a single variable.
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Techniques of integration. Applications of the definite
integral to area, volume, arc length, and surface area. Improper integrals. Sequences and series:
convergence tests, integral, comparison, ratio and root tests. Alternating series. Absolute and
conditional convergence. Power series. Taylor and Maclaurin series.

**Prerequisite:** Math 101

**Learning Outcomes:**

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to

1. Use Riemann sums to estimate areas and approximate definite integrals.
2. State and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
3. Evaluate Integrals using various techniques of integration.
4. Calculate the average value of a function, areas between curves, length of curves, volumes and surface areas of solids of revolutions.
5. Identify and evaluate improper integrals.
6. Compute limits of sequences.
7. Apply convergence tests to determine the convergence and/or the divergence of series.
8. Evaluate the sum of some selected types of series.
9. Find the interval of convergence and radius of convergence of a power series.
10. Express a function as a power series.
